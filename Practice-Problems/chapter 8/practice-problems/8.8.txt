This program prints the string 213, which is the shorthand name of the CS:APP
course at Carnegie Mellon. The parent starts by printing ‘2’, then forks the child,
which spins in an infinite loop. The parent then sends a signal to the child and
waits for it to terminate. The child catches the signal (interrupting the infinite
loop), decrements the counter (from an initial value of 2), prints ‘1’, and then
terminates. After the parent reaps the child, it increments the counter (from an
initial value of 2), prints ‘3’, and terminates.
