### Overview

This repo contains source code and my solution to ***CMU 15-213: Introduction to
Computer System*** practice problems and [lab assignments](/CMU-15-213-Labs). I am using the `2015 Fall` version.

I am studying and coding on `Manjaro Linux 21.1.4`.

### About the book

- This book `CS:APP3e` is the third edition of a book that stems from the introductory computer systems course developed at `Carnegie Mellon University`, starting in the Fall of 1998, called `"Introduction to Computer Systems" (ICS)`. The presentation is based on the following principles, which aim to help the students become better programmers and to help prepare them for upper-level systems courses:

  - **Students should be introduced to computer systems from the perspective of a programmer, rather from the more traditional perspective of a system implementer.**
  - **Students should get a view of the complete system, comprising the hardware, operating system, compiler, and network.**
  - **Students learn best by developing and evaluating real programs that run on real machines.**

- The book covers `data representations`, `machine level representations of C programs`, `processor architecture`, `program optimizations`, `the memory hierarchy`, `linking`, `exceptional control flow (exceptions, interrupts, processes, and Unix signals)`, `virtual memory and memory management`, `system-level I/O`, `basic network programming`, and `concurrent programming`. These concepts are supported by series of fun and hands-on [lab assignments](/CMU-15-213-Labs).
