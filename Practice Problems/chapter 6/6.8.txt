The key to solving this problem is to visualize how the array is laid out in memory
and then analyze the reference patterns. Function clear1 accesses the array using
a stride-1 reference pattern and thus clearly has the best spatial locality. Function
clear2 scans each of the N structs in order, which is good, but within each struct it
hops around in a non-stride-1 pattern at the following offsets from the beginning
of the struct: 0, 12, 4, 16, 8, 20. So clear2 has worse spatial locality than clear1.
Function clear3 not only hops around within each struct, but also hops from struct
to struct. So clear3 exhibits worse spatial locality than clear2 and clear1.
